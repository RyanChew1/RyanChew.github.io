        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>CAC scans are heart CTs designed to calcualate the amount of calcium deposits in a patient's 
            heart.  However, these images can be very difficult for doctors and researchers to read by hand. 
            This project uses a UNET to quickly and accurately determine the amount of calcium in a scan.
            This will allow CAC scans to be more accurate and more efficient, thus making it more accessible to 
            individuals who need it.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            The raw dataset contained over 40,000 images from over 400 patients. Images were given in 
            DICOM file format. I loaded the images to numpy and created label segmentations from provided 
            XML annotations. All images were normalized on a range of zero to one before training. 

            <br>
            <br>

            The model is a PyTorch UNET with two 3x3 Conv layers per block and 
            padding of one to keep original dimensions. The model has a contracting path to 1024 and 
            uses ReLU activation. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to determine optimal learning rate and batch size,
            the model ultimately used a 0.1 inital learning rate with ReduceLROnPlateau for scheduler. The loss function
            was also experimented with, and the best model came from BCE or Tversky loss due to a big class imbalance. 
            The model predicts segmentations with 0.85 dice accuracy.
