        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Recently getting into weight training and starting to lift more, I came to a realization that
             many people are intimidated or afraid to start exercising. Exercise and fitness is an 
             essential part of maintaining one's physical and mental well-being, but the motivation 
             to start is often not there or could seem out of reach. Fit.ly is designed to welcome 
             people to start living healthier lifestyles and begin their fitness journey.

             <br>
             <br>
             There are two essential components of Fit.ly, a rep tracker and a workout generator. 
             The Rep tracker uses movement and pose detection to count reps, ensuring a correct and
              full range of motion on each exercise. The second feature is a workout generator. Many
               people don't stick to a plan or find it hard to get a good workout plan. Listening to 
               people online for guidance is useful but often overwhelming. Truth is, each person's 
               workout plan should be tailored to their goals and circumstances. The workout generator
                allows users to input several parameters to generate a personalized seven-day workout 
                plan.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            The entire application is built with Streamlit, including all forms, buttons, inputs, 
            video outputs, and more. Everything was written with python, with Jupyter notebooks exported 
            into python scripts.
        The rep counter was built off of a foundational YOLv8Pose model, fine-tuning was used on another 
        dataset but was not used due to little improvement in accuracy. I then implemented a non-maximum
        suppression and used both confidence and filter by area to ensure only the subject will be counter.
         This ensures that people in the background will not interfere with the rep count. In order to 
         count reps, I determined the angle between different keypoints. For instance, I used the 
         shoulder, elbow and hand to determine what state of a curl they are in. I also didn't count 
         bad reps such as a bent arm in lateral raises using the same idea. Angles can be tweaked to 
         give more or less leeway.
